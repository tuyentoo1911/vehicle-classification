Vehicle Classification Project

Description
This project aims to classify vehicles into different categories based on images. It uses machine learning techniques to train a model that can accurately predict the type of vehicle from input images. The project is built using TensorFlow and Keras.

Features
- Image classification: Classify images into various vehicle categories.
- Deep Learning: Utilizes CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) for feature extraction and classification.
- Model Training: Pretrained models are used, and fine-tuning is performed with custom datasets.

Installation
Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV (if required for data preprocessing)

Setup:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tuyentoo1911/vehicle-classification.git
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

Usage
1. Training the Model:
   After setting up the environment, you can train the model by running:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```
